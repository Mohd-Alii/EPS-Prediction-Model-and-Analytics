# EPS Prediction Model for NYSE Stocks

## Project Description
This project is focused on developing a machine learning model to predict the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The EPS is a critical financial metric that indicates a company's profitability and is widely used by investors to make informed decisions.

### Objectives
- **Data Analytics:** Perform comprehensive data analysis on NYSE-listed companies to extract relevant financial and market features.
- **Machine Learning:** Develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts EPS based on historical data and selected features.
- **Investment Insights:** Provide valuable insights to investors and financial analysts to enhance their decision-making process.

### Key Components
- **Data Collection:** Historical stock prices, financial statements, and other relevant data were gathered from NYSE companies.
- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset was cleaned, missing values were handled, and relevant features were selected. The data was then normalized to ensure consistency.
- **Feature Engineering:** Key financial ratios and market indicators were identified as influential factors in predicting EPS.
- **Model Development:** A machine learning model was built and trained using these features, achieving an accuracy of 81% in EPS prediction.
- **Evaluation and Visualization:** The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, and key findings were visualized to provide clear insights.

### Outcomes
- **EPS Prediction Accuracy:** The model demonstrated an 81% accuracy rate in predicting EPS, making it a reliable tool for financial analysis.
- **Investor Utility:** The project provides investors with a powerful tool to forecast company performance, potentially improving investment strategies.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Python:** Used for data analysis, feature selection, and model development.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** Provided an interactive environment for developing and testing the model.
- **Pandas & NumPy:** Utilized for data manipulation and numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn:** Employed for building and evaluating the machine learning model.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used for data visualization to interpret results.

### Future Work
- **Model Enhancement:** Explore additional machine learning techniques to further improve prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Expansion:** Integrate more financial and market data to refine the model.
- **Real-time Predictions:** Implement the model in a web application for real-time EPS prediction.
